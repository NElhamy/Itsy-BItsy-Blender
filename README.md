Welcome to my "ItsyBitsy-Blender" project! In this Blender animation, I've created a simple mechanical spider model and rigged it for a walking animation. I also added a unique twist to the animation by including a button that triggers a color change in the environment lighting as the spider steps on it.

## About the Animation

- **Spider Model**: I designed a straightforward mechanical spider model to demonstrate the walking animation. The spider has a simple rig that allows it to move its legs as it walks.

- **Walking Animation**: The spider's walking animation showcases its movement. Watch as it takes its steps and moves across the scene.

- **Color Change Button**: As the spider steps on a button, the environment lighting changes color. The color shifts from purple to red while the spider is on the button and reverts to purple as it steps off.

## Project Scope

This project is a mini exploration into rigging and animation within Blender, inspired by Polyfjord's tutorial. It allowed me to experiment with creating a rig for a character, animating its movement, and incorporating interactive elements into the animation.

I followed Polyjford's tutorial on YouTube to create the spider character, rig it, and animate its walk. While I focused on this fun spider animation, my primary area of concentration is character sculpting. I'm excited to develop my skills in character modeling, and animation remains a goal for the future.

## Goals

- This project serves as a creative demonstration of animation in Blender, including rigging and scripting interactions.

- I aimed to keep it simple, yet engaging, by adding a dynamic element with the color-changing button.

- Character sculpting remains my main focus, and I anticipate creating more captivating characters down the road.

Feel free to explore the ItsyBitsy spider animation, provide feedback, or follow my creative journey. I hope you find it entertaining and inspiring!
